# My Personal Website 
This is my personal website, I took the great work that kavpreet grewal as a template

This site was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS. All of the HTML can currently be found in the index.html file. The CSS and the JS can be found in their respective folders and are divided according to their functions. All the images, files, and other resources are tucked away in the res folder.
